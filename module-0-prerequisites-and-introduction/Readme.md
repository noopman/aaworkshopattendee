# Instructions for Updating the Project After Pushing to GitHub

## 1. Update the Prerequisites and Introduction Document

- In **Prerequisites and Introduction.md**, update Step 4.
- Replace the placeholder URL for the template repository with the actual GitHub path where students will clone the project.

## 2. Check Workflow Files

- The workflow files are currently set to run on the `master` branch by default.
- If your branch name differs (e.g., `main` or another name), update the branch reference in both workflow files to match the correct branch name.

## 3. Avoid Creating New Branches

- After pushing the code to the chosen branch. **Do not** create additional branches!
- Creating new branches will trigger the workflow files, causing the placeholders `{Owner}` and `{Repo}` to be automatically replaced with values from your GitHub repository.
